			description: "The Fontanesia Pallida is an extremely common, tall plant and can be found almost anywhere. It blooms twice a year, for 3 weeks. It has small, wedge shaped leaves,	which are usually dark green.It also grows quite small flowers, which can be orange, dark purple, silver and light gold.These plants grow in small numbers,	but it 's a bit tricky to control and maintain their growth. They have no real use.As a defense mechanism the Fontanesia Pallida can collapse its flowers when it detects vibrations.They rely on wind pollination to reproduce.Once pollinated, they grow small, inedible nuts."

			description: "Gray, shaggy hair slightly reveals a full, lived-in face. Clear green eyes, set handsomely within their sockets, watch carefully over the sea they've nearly died for for so long. Fire has left a mark reaching from just under the left eyebrow, running towards his left nostril and ending on his forehead leaves a lasting punishment of his reckless luck.This is the face of Brycen Afton,	a true victor among humans.He stands alluringly among others, despite his light frame.There 's something obscure about him, perhaps it' s a feeling of hospitality or perhaps it 's simply his painful past. But nonetheless, people tend to pretend to be his best friend, while helping him out in any way they can."

			description: "The nation of Costan. Built upon the war, wisdom and intelligence of its past, this nation is now among the most troubled countries in its corner of the world. Their literacy, science and fuel production are among its current greatest strengths.Unfortunately they lack a lot in income and medicine.Costan is a democratic nation.There are a couple of opposing groups against the current leadership, but this is only a recent occurance.However, the current greatest threat to the nation is a huge forest fire, but the current leadership lacks resources to solve this issue.The people of Costan are pessimistic.They live unenjoyable lives, but while income is really lacking, their literacy helps relief some of their issues.Religion holds a fair deal of importance in their lives and, ifanything, has made them more honest.The people of Costan aren 't really spiritual however and they, but they do have beautiful customs and special rituals."
